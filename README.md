## What are ghost guns?
Ghost guns are privately made firearms without serial numbers, making them untraceable and unregulated. Ghost guns are mostly either assembled through ready-to-assemble kits or components sold individually.
Prior to the ATF rule 2021R-05F in 2022, there was a loop hole in what defined a firearm that allowed gun kit manufacturers to produce unfinished parts without serial numbers. These incomplete parts can be easily finished in a matter of a couple hours.
In addition to that, currently, federal laws still allow individuals to make firearms for personal use without a license. Overall, this creates a major flaw in state-level regulations, which leads to the proliferation of ghost guns.
